This is an example of a program where the cyclomatic complexity of each function equals 1:
- all loops are converted into recursive function calls,
- all branching statements are replaced with arithmetic and logical calculations

This program converts an arithmetical expression into the postfix form

Expression should be composed of following characters:
  alphabetical low-case characters 'a'-'z',
  additive low-priority operations '+' and '-',
  multiplicative high-priority operations '*' and '/',
  round brackets '(' and ')'.

Example:
  a+(b+c*d)*e+f/g+h   ->   abcd*+e*+fg/+h+
